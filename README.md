### Project Overview

I developed an interactive KPI dashboard using Excel to monitor and evaluate the performance of nine key performance indicators (KPIs) across nineteen branches. The dashboard provides both monthly and annual insights, comparing actual results against budget targets. It allows users to filter data dynamically by branch and time period, offering a clear and detailed view of each branchâ€™s performance. This tool enhances decision-making by identifying variances, trends, and opportunities for improvement in real time, supporting more effective strategic planning and operational management.

### Data Source

The primary dataset used for this analysis is "KPI DASHBOARD DATA SOURCE.csv" containing actual figures and the budgeted figures for each branch, for the month and year.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the data cleaning, preparation, and analysis phase, I perfomed the following tasks:

  1. Data Analysis; Variance Analysis
  2. Use of advanced formulas
  3. Pivot table creation
  4. Inserting slicers
  5. Creation of a visual report

### Data Analysis

I performed data analysis through Excel; using the following steps;

**1. Importing Data**

 - Actual Data - Importing data from the Core Banking System, a centralized software platform used to manage the branches' network day-to-day banking operations.
   
 - Budgeted Data - Extracting data from the board approved annual budget of the bank for the year. Our annual budget is allocated based on branch classification: Alfa receives 100%, Bravo 90%, and Charlie 80%. Depending on the KPI, the budget is either distributed equally or adjusted according to these classifications.
   
**2. Variance Analysis**

 - Conducted a variance analysis by comparing actual KPI performance against budgeted targets.
  
 - Applied formulas to calculate the difference between actuals and targets for each branch and classification.
  
 - Highlighted positive or negative variances for easier identification of areas needing attention.

**3. Inserting Pivot Tables**

 - Created Pivot Tables to summarize and organize the data by branch, KPI, and time period (monthly/annually).
  
 - Inserted relevant data fields into rows, columns, and values to create a clear structure for analysis.
  
 - Used calculated fields to perform custom calculations where necessary.
  
**4. Using Slicers**

 - Added slicers to allow dynamic filtering of data in the Pivot Tables
  
 - Linked slicers to the branch classification and time periods to enable easy navigation and comparison across branches and timeframes.
  
**5. Visual Report Creation**

Designed a visual report page that included:

  - A PivotChart for a graphical representation of KPI performance

  - A Donut Chart to visually display the distribution of key metrics

  - A data table connected to the slicers, providing an interactive view of filtered results

Ensured all elements (charts and tables) were interconnected with slicers to allow for real-time adjustments and insights based on selected criteria.

### Results and Findings

Some of the outstanding conclusions from this report as at September 2024 are;

1. The outstanding KPI is Trade Finance commissions with a whooping 92M in income as at September 2024.

2. The bank made a loss of 237M as at September, with the Head Office carrying the bigger percentage due to high operating expenses.

3. If the bank cuts down its operating expenses, it will improve in profitability.

### Limitations

- Excel user difficulty from the report consumers, a training on basic excel features is yet to be done.
